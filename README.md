Cowgol utilities
================
This repository contains some single-file utilities written in the
[Cowgol](http://cowlark.com/cowgol/) programming language.

The utilities here are written on and built on an OpenBSD/amd64
system. These utilities are tested on modern Unix built with the
cgen backend, PDP-11 with the unixv7 backend, and Intel 8080 with
the CP/M backend. They should work on all supported Cowgol systems.

Utilities list
--------------
* bfc.cow: Brainfuck to Cowgol transpiler
* hexdump.cow: Clone of the OpenBSD `hexdump -C` utility
